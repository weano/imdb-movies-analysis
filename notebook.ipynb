    "Hello! This is the first data science project I will be conducting, outside of any academic or professional environment, for the purposes of uploading for public view. I had originally considered a finance-based dataset, but stumbled upon this (at the time)fresh dataset on Kaggle that contained both qualitative and quantitative data, and more importantly, centred around a field that I have a personal interest in: films. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intended goal of this notebook, from a personal and professional development standpoint, is to display the application of certain data science related concepts that I have been learning primarily through my postgraduate program at the University of the West Indies, Mona, and secondarily through independent study using online resources. In terms of business applications, this project aims to classify certain films based on variables such as runtime, and genre, to recommend to cinema operations staff those films that may provide the greatest revenue.\n",
